        Personal data is information about your identity. This includes information such as name, address, telephone number and e-mail address.
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, you can visit our website without leaving any personal data behind, e.g. if you only want to inform yourself about our products and call up the corresponding pages. The accesses made to our homepage and each retrieval of a file stored on the homepage are logged. The storage serves internal system-related and statistical purposes. Logged: Browser type/version, operating system used, referrer URL (the previously visited page), host name of the accessing computer (IP address), time of server request. However, no personal data will be transmitted on your part and this information will be stored separately from any personal data transmitted. In addition, the IP addresses of the requesting computers are logged.
    </p>
    <p>
        In certain cases, however, we need your name and address as well as other information so that we can provide the desired services. This further personal data is only collected and stored if you provide this information voluntarily, for example as part of an inquiry, a registration, an application as an employee or potential supplier or when placing and processing orders. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <br><b>3. Purposes and legal bases</b><br>
        If you provide us with personal data, we will only use it to answer your inquiries (legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a, b or f DSGVO) and to process projects (legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a, b or f DSGVO) with regard to advertising measures vis-à-vis you (legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a, b or f DSGVO). 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO) in order to provide you with access to certain information or offers or to use information and communication systems (legal basis here is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, b or f DSGVO) and within the framework of statutory provisions (legal basis here is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO).
        We will collect, process and use the personal data you provide online only for the purposes disclosed to you. Your personal data will only be passed on to third parties or otherwise transferred if this is necessary for the purpose of carrying out the activities mentioned here, e.g. if service providers are called in or if you have given your prior consent to the transfer. These third parties may not use the data for other purposes.
        Of course, we will respect your wishes if you do not wish to provide us with your personal data to support our customer relationship (in particular for direct marketing or market research purposes).<br>
        We only disclose personal data about customers or suppliers if we are required to do so by law (legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c DSGVO), or if we are required to do so by a court decision (legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c or f DSGVO) or if the disclosure is necessary to enforce or protect our General Terms and Conditions or other agreements (legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. c or f DSGVO). This applies mutatis mutandis to the storage of data.<br>
        The data will not be disclosed for commercial purposes.<br>

    </p>
    <p>
        <br><b>7. Cookies</b><br>
        a) General<br>
        We do not pass on your data to third parties without a legal basis. We also do not pass on your data to third countries unless you are in a third country or the processing of contracts requires the transfer of your data to a third country. In order to make visiting our website attractive and to enable the use of certain functions, we use so-called cookies on various pages. These are small text files that are stored on your terminal device. Some of the cookies we use are deleted after the end of the browser session, i.e. after closing your browser (so-called session cookies). Other cookies remain on your end device and enable us or our partner companies to recognize your browser during your next visit (persistent cookies). We use cookies to personalise content and advertisements and to analyse access to our website. We also share information about your use of our site with our social media, advertising and analytics partners. Details can be found at: http://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners/.<br><br>
        b) Legal base<br>
        At this moment we are using cookies on the basis of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO as legal basis. As described above, we have legitimate interests in the use of cookies and the use of cookies is necessary to achieve these interests (for example, legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both our Web site and our advertising). We have examined whether the predominant interests of visitors to our website are opposed to the use of cookies, but in the overall view we have come to the conclusion that this is not the case.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <br><b>8. Google Analytics</b><br>
        This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").<br>
        <br>

Google will use the stored information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity for website operators and to provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage.<br>
        Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.<br><br>
        You may object to the collection of data at any time with effect for the future by using the Google Analytics deactivation add-on for browsers at

        Deactivate Google Analytics<br><br>
        We point out that this website uses Google Analytics with the extension "_anonymizeIp()". This means that IP addresses are stored exclusively in anonymous form, thus excluding any direct personal reference in connection with the stored data.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <br><b>9. Google Tag Manager</b><br>
        This website uses the Google Tag Manager. This service allows website tags to be managed through an interface. The Google Tool Manager only implements tags. This means that no cookies are used and no personal data is collected. Google Tool Manager triggers other tags that may collect data. However, the Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If a deactivation has been made at the domain or cookie level, it remains valid for all tracking tags if they are implemented with the Google Tag Manager.<br><br>

        If your data should not be correct, you can of course also request a correction or completion of your data.<br>
        You may also request that your data be deleted unless processing is necessary to exercise your right to freedom of expression and information, to fulfil a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or to assert, exercise or defend legal claims. We will comply with this request for deletion immediately, but must of course comply with any applicable legal storage regulations.<br>
        You may also demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data insofar as the accuracy of the data is disputed by you, the processing is unlawful, but you refuse to delete it and we no longer need the data, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or you have lodged an objection against the processing pursuant to Art. 21 DSGVO.<br>
        If you have given your consent to the use of data, you can revoke it at any time with effect for the future.<br>
        You also have the right to data transfer. We will make your data available to you in a machine-readable format if you make a corresponding request.<br>
        If your personal data is processed on the basis of legitimate interests pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f DSGVO, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data pursuant to Art. 21 DSGVO if there are reasons for doing so which arise from your particular situation or if the objection is directed against direct advertising. In the latter case, you have a general right of objection, which is implemented by us without stating a particular situation.<br>
        All requests for information, requests for information, requests for deletion, etc. or objections to data processing should be directed to the contact details of our data protection officer given below.<br>

        <br><b>12. Data security</b><br>
        We maintain current technical measures to ensure data security, in particular to protect your personal data from the dangers of data transmission and from third parties gaining knowledge. These will be adapted to the current state of the art.<br>

    <p>
        <br><b>13. Change of our data protection declaration</b><br>
        We reserve the right to change our security and data protection measures as far as this becomes necessary due to technical or legal developments or in case of justified legitimate interests.

    </p>
    <p>
